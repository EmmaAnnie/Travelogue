        <h2>Canmore, Alberta</h2>
        <p>
            The first trip on my bucket list is somewhere a little closer to home. Canmore is a
            great place to go if you want a mountain getaway while still being closer to home
            if you live in Alberta. I've always wanted to try staying in a cabin in the woods up 
            in the mountains, with the amazing scenery and privacy when I want a little down time. 
            Recently, a friend suggested that Canmore is the place to go if you want to find a nice 
            Airbnb, where you can go on all sorts of tours and do a lot of sightseeing. The perfect 
            thing about Canmore is that it doesn't get too busy, even around tourist season like other 
            vacation spots might. The more I hear about Canmore, the more I realize it is the best place
            to try for my first time travelling as a young adult.

        <h2>Orlando, Florida (Universal Studios)</h2>
        <p>
            This destination sort of brings out my inner child. Since I was a kid, I've always enjoyed
            theme parks and being able to keep myself busy while on vacation. Universal Studios I feel is 
            a great place to go on all kinds of adventures you usually only see on TV, including Jurassic 
            Park, Transformers, and Harry Potter. The thing I would like most about this trip is that I 
            wouldn't have to spend all my time in Universal Studios. There is so much more in Orlando and 
            I wouldn't have to be stuck in one place, especially if I wanted some much needed down time. 
            This trip may be something I wouldn't do until a few more years, but I still look forward to it.

        <h2>Europe</h2>
        <p>
            This trip I couldn't limit to a single country. I've heard many great things about Europe and
            the destinations I could visit. One of my friends recently spent some time in Europe and told 
            me all about the places he thought were amazing and would visit again, as well as the places 
            he thought weren't as special. One splace that has great reviews is Switzerland. Switzerland is
            somewhere I feel would be a great place for sightseeing and many fun activities. The Swiss Alps 
            in particular would be a great place for skiing, hiking, and snowboarding for those who love 
            winter activities as well as amazing scenery for those who just love the view. This trip is
            definitely a far future trip, but still something I would love to try before my thirties.
