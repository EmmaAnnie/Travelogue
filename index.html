        <h2>Canmore, Alberta</h2>
        <p>The first trip on my bucket list is somewhere a little closer to home. Canmore is a
            great place to go if you want a mountain getaway while still being closer to home
            if you live in Alberta. I've always wanted to try staying in a cabin in the woods up 
            in the mountains, with the amazing scenery and privacy when I want a little down time. 
            Recently, a friend suggested that Canmore is the place to go if you want to find a nice 
            Airbnb, where you can go on all sorts of tours and do a lot of sightseeing. The perfect 
            thing about Canmore is that it doesn't get too busy, even around tourist season like other 
            vacation spots might. The more I hear about Canmore, the more I realize it is the best place
            to try for my first time travelling as a young adult.
